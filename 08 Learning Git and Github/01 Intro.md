# 🚀 Travel the Multiverse with Git & GitHub

> _"The best history class would give each student a time machine so they could go back and **document history**.  
> The problem? People would be tempted not just to **document**, but also to **change history**."_

## 🕰 Git: Your Personal Time Machine for Code

Git is exactly that — a **developer’s time machine**.  
It lets you:

1. **Document the history** of a project  
2. **Travel back in time** to see previous versions  
3. **Branch into alternate timelines** to experiment without breaking the main story  
4. **Merge alternate histories** into the main timeline if you like the outcome

Think of your project’s commit history like the **multiverse of code** — each branch is a parallel universe, each commit a snapshot in time.

## ☁ GitHub: The Cloud Portal for Collaboration

While Git works locally on your computer, **GitHub** takes things to the next level:

- Stores your project in the cloud 🌐
- Lets you collaborate with other developers in real time  
- Tracks every change made by every contributor  
- Manages pull requests, code reviews, and discussions

In short:  
**Git is the time machine** 🕰  
**GitHub is the time machine's control center** 🎛

## 📂 Getting the Exercise Files

If you're following along with this course, here’s how to grab the files:

1. **Visit the provided repository link** (course URL).
2. At the top of the page, look for the **branch dropdown menu**:
   - Select the branch named:  
     ```
     01_02b
     ```
3. Click the green **Code** button.
4. Choose **Download ZIP**.
5. Once downloaded, **extract** (unzip) the files.
6. **Rename the folder** to:


```
This is the working folder we’ll use throughout the course.
```

## 💡 Deep-Dive Notes for Developers

Since we're aiming for deep understanding, let's unpack **why** this process matters:

- **Branch Selection (`01_02b`)**  
Git repositories can have multiple branches, each representing a different state of the project.  
Selecting the right branch ensures you start from the correct snapshot in history.

- **Downloading as ZIP**  
This is a quick, no-Git way to grab the code — perfect if you just want to explore without installing Git yet.  
But remember:  
- ZIP downloads **do not preserve Git history**.  
- If you want the time machine’s full power (commits, branches, logs), you should **clone** the repo instead:
 ```bash
 git clone -b 01_02b <repository_url> learninggithub
 ```
 This way, you keep the commit history and can practice branching and merging.

- **Renaming the Folder**  
Keeping consistent naming helps in tutorials, scripts, and commands.

## 🔮 Final Thought

When you **learn Git and GitHub**, you’re not just learning tools —  
you’re learning **how to control time and parallel realities in your codebase**.  

With Git, you can:
- Safely experiment
- Undo mistakes
- Collaborate without fear of overwriting work

With GitHub, you can:
- Share your timeline
- Merge universes
- Invite other travelers into your project’s multiverse

**So… ready to step into your developer’s time machine?** 🚀
