# GitHub Shortcut Features

GitHub's website has a massive collection of keyboard shortcuts — possibly more than most programs you’ve ever used. Here’s a breakdown of some of the most useful ones mentioned by the instructor, along with explanations and usage examples.

---

## 1. **The Question Mark (`?`)**

* **Purpose:** Opens a list of most available shortcuts.
* **Context-sensitive:** The list changes depending on where you are on the site.
* **Extra:** Contains a link to GitHub’s full shortcut documentation.
* **Tip:** If you remember only one shortcut, make it this one.

---

## 2. **Slash (`/`) – Search**

* **Purpose:** Opens the search bar.
* **Context-sensitive:**

  * Inside a repository: searches within that repository.
  * On your profile or GitHub home: searches all repositories you have access to.
* **Examples:**

  * Type `.html` to find all HTML files in the current repo.
  * Use arrow keys to navigate search results, then press **Enter** to open.

## 3. **Command Palette**

* **Shortcut:**

  * **Mac:** `Command + K`
  * **Windows/Linux:** `Control + K`
* **Purpose:** Like a code editor’s command palette — lets you:

  * Jump to repositories.
  * View projects.
  * Execute various GitHub actions quickly.
* **Extra:** Can also be opened via a small button in the UI.

## 4. **Navigation Shortcuts (G + Key)**

* **Examples:**

  * `G` + `I` → Go to Issues tab.
  * `G` + `P` → Go to Pull Requests tab.
* **Tip:** Learn these to reduce mouse usage entirely.

---

## 5. **Period (`.`) – Open `github.dev` Editor**

* **Purpose:** Opens a lightweight, VS Code–like web editor.
* **URL change:** From `github.com/...` → `github.dev/...`
* **Pros:**

  * Opens faster than Codespaces.
  * Great for quick edits.
  * Can share the URL with others to open directly in the editor.
* **Limitations:** Cannot run build processes like full Codespaces.

---

## 6. **`github.new` / `repo.new`**

* **Purpose:** Creates a new repository instantly.
* **Tip:** Two different shortcuts, but both lead to the same new repo creation page.

---

## 7. **Feature Preview**

* **Location:** In GitHub settings.
* **Purpose:** Allows enabling beta/upcoming features before public release.
* **Example:**

  * Command palette improvements.
  * Experimental UI changes.
* **Tip:** If your GitHub UI looks different from someone else’s, check if feature previews are enabled.
