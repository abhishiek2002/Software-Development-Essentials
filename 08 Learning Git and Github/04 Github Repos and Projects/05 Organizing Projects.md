# Organizing Projects in GitHub

## Overview

GitHub offers multiple tools for project management, collaboration, and tracking progress. These include **collaborators**, **issues**, **labels**, **milestones**, and **projects**. When combined, they help streamline workflows and maintain project organization.

## Core Project Management Features

### 1. Collaborators

* Invite others to work on your repository.
* Works for **public repos** or with a **GitHub Pro** account.
* Invitation process:

  1. Go to **Settings → Collaborators**.
  2. Click **Add people**.
  3. Search by username, email, or full name.
  4. Invite — they will receive an email notification.

### 2. Issues

* Use issues to track tasks, bugs, enhancements, or questions.
* Can be assigned to specific collaborators.
* Can include comments and attachments for discussion.

**Enhancements to Issues:**

* **Labels:** Categorize issues (e.g., `bug`, `help wanted`). Multiple labels allowed.
* **Milestones:** Group issues under larger goals (e.g., “Final Review”).
* **Assignees:** Assign one or more collaborators to work on an issue.

**Example:**

* Title: *Please check my work so far*
* Assignee: `@jojohumphreys`
* Label: `help wanted`
* Milestone: `Final Review`

**Activity Tracking:**

* GitHub records changes to assignees, labels, and milestones.
* Updates appear in the issue’s timeline.

### 3. Comments and Mentions

* Comment directly on issues for discussion.
* Use `@username` to mention people and notify them.

### 4. Creating Issues from Feedback

Example:

* Title: *Fix spelling with GitHub*
* Description: “GitHub should have a capital H.”
* Assign to `@yourself` or another team member.
* Label: `bug`
* Milestone: `Final Review`

## Using Projects for Organization

### Creating a Project

1. Navigate to the **Projects** tab.
2. Click **New project** (or link to an existing one).
3. Choose a view type:

   * **Table view**: Spreadsheet-style organization.
   * **Board (Kanban)**: Columns for “To do,” “In progress,” and “Done.”
   * **Roadmap**: Timeline-based planning.
4. Name the project (e.g., *Special Project*).
5. Add a description if desired.

### Adding Items to a Project

* **Draft issues**: Brainstorm ideas that can later be converted to issues.
* **Existing issues**: Link issues from the repository.
* Projects can span **multiple repositories**.

### Kanban Workflow Example

* Columns: `To do` → `In progress` → `Done`.
* Add an issue (e.g., *Fix spelling errors on site*).
* Assign collaborators, labels, and milestones.
* Track progress visually.

## Benefits of Using GitHub’s Organizational Tools

* Centralized task tracking.
* Clear assignment of responsibilities.
* Progress tracking through milestones and project boards.
* Better collaboration through mentions, comments, and notifications.
* Adaptable to various workflows (Agile, Kanban, etc.).

**In summary:**
By combining **collaborators**, **issues**, **labels**, **milestones**, and **projects**, GitHub enables both simple and advanced project organization. This setup ensures efficient collaboration, progress tracking, and structured workflows for any development team.
