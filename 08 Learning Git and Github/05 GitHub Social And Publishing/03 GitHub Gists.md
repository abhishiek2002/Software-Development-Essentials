# GitHub Gists – Quick Reference Guide

## Overview

GitHub Gists let you share and store code snippets with others. They can be public or secret and work seamlessly with your GitHub account.

---

## Accessing Gists

* **Dedicated site:** [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com)
* **Shortcut:** `gist.new` → Opens new gist creation page.
* View latest or all your gists from your profile.

---

## Creating a Gist

1. **Add optional description**
2. **Specify filename with extension** (for syntax highlighting)

   * Example: `bootstrap5.html`
3. **Paste code**

   * Control indentation (tabs/spaces) and wrapping.
4. **(Optional)** Add multiple files to one gist.
5. **Choose visibility:**

   * Public
   * Secret (only accessible via direct link)
6. **Click** `Create public gist` or `Create secret gist`

## Editing & Managing Gists

* **Revisions:** View change history with GitHub's diff view (unified or split).
* **Embed:** Copy embed code to display gist on an HTML page.
* **Download:** Save gist as a ZIP file (includes all files).
* **Comments:** Allow others to give feedback; receive notifications.
* **Star:** Bookmark gists you like.
* **Edit/Delete:** Modify or remove your gists anytime.

## Collaboration Features

* **Fork a gist:** Create your own copy of someone else’s gist (original author credited).
* **Notifications:** Gist comments and activity appear in your GitHub notifications.

## Related Actions

* Switch between Gists and main GitHub profile.
* Access starred gists list.
* Use gist search to find examples from others.

---

## Best Practices

* Use clear filenames with correct extensions for proper syntax highlighting.
* Include descriptions for context.
* Keep public gists clean and functional—others may use them.
* Fork useful gists instead of copy-pasting into unrelated files.

**Pro Tip:** Gists are ideal for reusable code snippets, configuration examples, or quick prototypes you want to share without creating a full repository.
