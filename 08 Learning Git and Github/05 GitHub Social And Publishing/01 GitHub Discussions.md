# **GitHub Discussions – Guide**

GitHub Discussions is a dedicated space for threaded, community-driven conversations about your project that are **not necessarily tied to bug fixes** or code changes. It builds on the familiar GitHub Issues interface but offers extra community features.

---

## **1. Purpose of Discussions**

* Encourages open-ended conversations unrelated to specific bugs.
* Used for Q\&A, brainstorming, polls, and community engagement.
* Initially, these conversations happened in Issues; GitHub split them into their own feature.
* Conversations can be **converted into Issues** if they lead to actionable work.

## **2. Enabling Discussions**

1. Go to **Settings → Enable Discussions**.
2. Select **Set up Discussions**.
3. Create a **welcome post** (automatically pinned at the top).
4. GitHub will provide default categories (e.g., Q\&A, Ideas, Polls) — you can edit, delete, or add new ones.

## **3. Organizing Discussions**

* **Categories**: Organize conversations into topics (Q\&A, Ideas, Polls, etc.).
* **Sections**: Group related categories together.
* **Pins**: Up to 4 Discussions can be pinned to the top of the page and/or within their category.
* **Search & Filters**: Filter by author, status (open/closed), labels, etc.

## **4. Discussion Features**

* **Voting**: Upvote/downvote to surface popular discussions.
* **Polls**: Gather community opinions with multiple-choice polls.
* **Markdown Support**: Rich formatting, mentions, task lists, and references to Issues/PRs.
* **Comments**: Reply to specific points, react with emojis, quote replies, or link directly to a comment.
* **Labels & Notifications**: Apply labels for organization and control notification settings.
* **Moderation**: Hide/delete/report comments, lock conversations, or transfer Discussions to another repository.

## **5. Converting Discussions into Issues**

* Non-poll Discussions have a **"Convert to Issue"** button.
* Copies all discussion content into a new Issue for tracking.
* Ideal for when a conversation produces an actionable feature request or bug report.

---

## **6. Insights & Analytics**

* Once you have active Discussions, the **Insights → Community** tab shows:

  * Contribution activity
  * Participation metrics
  * Engagement trends
* Data is limited for new projects but grows as community activity increases.

---

## **7. Closing Discussions**

* Reasons for closing:

  * Outdated
  * Duplicate
  * Resolved/Answered
* Closed Discussions cannot be commented on unless reopened.

---

## **8. Best Practices**

* Use **clear categories** for better discoverability.
* Pin important or frequently referenced Discussions.
* Regularly convert relevant threads into Issues.
* Encourage voting to surface high-interest topics.
* Use polls to make decision-making more engaging.

**Key takeaway:** GitHub Discussions blends the structured nature of Issues with the community feel of forums like Reddit, making it a powerful tool for fostering collaboration and idea-sharing around your projects.
