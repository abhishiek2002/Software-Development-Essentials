## 1. Top Navigation & Global Controls

* The top bar gives account-level actions (search, new repo, codespace, create).
* Quick buttons show *notifications*, *pull requests*, *issues*, and *your profile* — these are shortcuts to the global views for the account/organization.
* Use the search box to find repos, code, issues, and users. Repository metadata (description, topics) strongly influences search relevance.

---

## 2. Repo Header: Name, Social Metrics & What They Mean

* **Name**: repository identifier `owner/name` (e.g., `alice/my-lib`).
* **Watchers / Watch**: subscription to notifications. Options: *Not watching*, *Watching*, *Custom* depending on what notifications you want.
* **Forks**: gives a snapshot (a full fork of the git history) so another developer can make independent changes. Forks are commonly used to propose changes via PRs.
* **Stars**: lightweight endorsement/bookmark for discoverability — popular projects attract more contributors.
* **Topics & Description**: short description, website URL, and topics influence search and help other developers quickly understand the repo.

**Tip:** keep a short, searchable description and set topics (tags). Add `README.md` badges for CI, build status, license, and coverage.

---

## 3. Branches, Tags, Releases — Concepts & Workflows

* **Branches**: live lines of development (e.g., `main`, `dev`, `feature/*`). Branches contain commits and evolve over time.
* **Tags**: immutable labels that point to a specific commit (often used for releases). Tags are usually semantic versions like `v1.2.0`.
* **Releases**: a GitHub concept layered on tags — releases provide release notes and the ability to attach binary assets.

**Workflow example:** use `feature/*` branches for work → open PR into `main` or `release/*` → after approval, merge and create a tag `vX.Y.Z` → publish release with notes and assets.

---

## 4. Clone & Download Options (HTTPS / SSH / CLI)

**Clone methods:**

* **HTTPS** (easiest): `git clone https://github.com/owner/repo.git`

  * Often requires storing credentials via a credential helper or using a Personal Access Token (PAT) for authenticated pushes.
* **SSH** (recommended for developers): `git clone git@github.com:owner/repo.git`

  * Requires generating an SSH key (`ssh-keygen`) and adding the public key to your GitHub account.
* **GitHub CLI**: `gh repo clone owner/repo` — integrates with workflows like creating PRs, issues, and running actions from the terminal.
* **Download ZIP**: quick, but not a git repo (no history).

**Why choose SSH over HTTPS?** fewer credential prompts and better for automation; HTTPS is simpler for one-off clones or users unfamiliar with SSH keys.

---

## 5. Codespaces & Dev Containers

* **Codespaces**: cloud-hosted VS Code environments pre-loaded with your repo — they run in the cloud and can be configured with a `.devcontainer` folder.
* **Dev container (`devcontainer.json`)**: describes environment (OS image, tools, extensions) so contributors get uniform dev environments.
* **Prebuilds** speed up Codespaces startup by pre-building container images.

**Use when**: you want low-friction onboarding, reproducible builds, or to avoid local environment setup.

---

## 6. Copilot in the Repo UI

* **Copilot** provides AI suggestions in editors and has repository-level hooks where you can ask questions about code.
* Not every account sees Copilot — it's a paid add-on for some features.

**Practical use:** quick explanations for complex functions, generating boilerplate, or exploring potential test scaffolding.

---

## 7. Main File Area: README, LICENSE, Editing & File Creation

* **README.md** is the primary project landing page (Markdown) — include what the project does, how to set it up, basic usage, and contribution guidelines.
* **LICENSE** file clarifies legal usage (MIT, Apache-2.0, GPL, etc.).
* **Edit in browser**: changes create a commit (you can commit to the current branch or open a branch + PR). Web edits are convenient for quick docs fixes.
* **Creating folders**: add files with `path/to/file.md` — GitHub creates folders implicitly. Folders cannot be empty; common pattern: place a `.gitkeep` or `.gitignore` placeholder if you need an empty directory.
* **Drag-and-drop upload**: upload files/folders via the UI; this creates commits.

**Tip:** keep README focused, but also include `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` for community projects.

---

## 8. Issues vs Discussions — When to Use Each

* **Issues**: track bugs, feature requests, and action items. Issues support labels, assignees, milestones, and templates.
* **Discussions**: for open-ended conversations, brainstorming, polls, and community interactions — not issues.

**Guideline:** use Issues for actionable work; use Discussions for community or design conversations.

---

## 9. Pull Requests — Review Process, Checks & Merge Options

* A **Pull Request (PR)** proposes changes from one branch (or fork) into another.
* **Review types**: *Approve*, *Request changes*, *Comment*.
* **Checks**: CI workflows run on PRs (unit tests, linters). PRs can require passing checks before merging.
* **Merge strategies**: *Merge commit*, *Squash and merge*, *Rebase and merge* — pick your policy for history cleanliness.
* **Templates**: `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` standardizes descriptions and checklists for reviewers.
* **Auto-merge**: you can enable automatic merging once required checks pass.

**Advanced:** use `CODEOWNERS` to auto-request reviewers for specific paths.

---

## 10. Actions — Automation

* **GitHub Actions** automates workflows (CI/CD). Workflows are `.github/workflows/*.yml` files.
* **Triggers**: `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule`, `workflow_dispatch` (manual), etc.
* **Runners**: hosted runners or self-hosted runners execute jobs.
* **Secrets**: store credentials/environment variables securely in repo settings and reference them in workflows.
* **Marketplace**: reuse community actions to build pipelines fast.

**Best practices:** pin action versions, use minimal permissions via `permissions:` in workflows, and avoid placing secrets inside workflow files.

---

## 11. Projects — Organizing Work

* Project boards let you visualize issues and PRs using columns (To do, In progress, Done) or the newer Projects (table-based) with custom fields.
* You can automate movements (e.g., move card to Done when PR merged).

**Use:** create a product roadmap, track milestone progress, and link issues/PRs to cards.

---

## 12. Wiki vs `docs/` Folder vs GitHub Pages

* **Wiki**: easy, separate git-backed wiki for documentation — good for collaborative docs that don’t belong in repo tree.
* **`docs/` folder**: keeps documentation with the codebase and can be used to power GitHub Pages.
* **GitHub Pages**: static site hosting from `main` branch, `gh-pages` branch, or `/docs` folder. Useful for project websites and API docs.

**Tip:** prefer `docs/` or a static-site generator (Docsify, Docusaurus) for versioned docs; wikis are fine for simple notes.

---

## 13. Security Features

* **Dependency graph & Dependabot**: monitors dependencies and can open PRs to update vulnerable packages.
* **Code scanning**: static analysis via Actions (e.g., CodeQL) to find security issues.
* **Secret scanning**: detects exposed secrets in code and alerts repository admins.
* **Security policy & SECURITY.md**: document how to report vulnerabilities.

**Actionable:** enable Dependabot alerts and code scanning for active projects.

---

## 14. Insights — What To Watch

* **Traffic**: clones, views, and referrers.
* **Commits / Contributors**: who’s contributing, commit frequency.
* **Code frequency**: additions/deletions over time.
* **Dependency graph** and **vulnerability alerts**.

**Why care:** these graphs help you assess community health, contribution velocity, and the impact of releases.

---

## 15. Settings: Visibility, Templates, and Deletion

* **Visibility**: public or private. Changing visibility affects discoverability and access.
* **Template repository**: make repo a template so others can create new repos pre-populated with code and files.
* **Archive vs Delete**: archive makes repo read-only; delete is permanent (requires explicit confirmation).
* **Repository transfer**: move repo ownership between users or organizations.

**Danger zone:** deleting a repo is irreversible — GitHub asks you to type the repo name to confirm.

---

## 16. Collaborators, Teams & Permissions

* **Collaborators** (personal repos): grant specific users push/pull/admin access.
* **Organizations & Teams**: grant granular permissions by team (useful for companies and open-source projects).
* Permission granularity: roles such as Read/Write/Maintain/Admin (exact naming may evolve) — always assign least privilege.

**Invite flow:** invite a collaborator → they accept → they can push/merge per permissions.

---

## 17. Branch Protection Rules — Examples & Recommended Rules

Use branch protection to enforce quality and prevent accidental changes on `main`/`release` branches.

**Common protection rules:**

* *Require pull request reviews before merging* (1+ approving reviewer).
* *Require status checks to pass before merging* (CI jobs must succeed).
* *Require linear history* (disallow merge commits if you prefer rebase/squash flow).
* *Require signed commits* to ensure commits are signed with GPG/SSH keys.
* *Restrict who can push* (only certain users or teams).
* *Require conversation resolution* before merging.

**Recommended minimal set for `main`:** require PR reviews + required status checks + restrict force pushes.

---

## 18. Releases & Deployments

* **Releases**: pair a tag with release notes and attach build artifacts (binary downloads, installers).
* **Tags**: `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"`
* **Deployments**: GitHub Pages, or full CD via Actions to cloud platforms. Actions can deploy to environments; environment protections can be applied.

**Example:** CI builds artifact on push → Actions publishes artifact and creates a draft release → once QA approves, release is published.

---

## 19. Quick Commands & UI Actions

* Clone: `git clone https://github.com/owner/repo.git` or `git clone git@github.com:owner/repo.git`
* Add remote: `git remote add origin <url>`
* Create a file in UI: `Add file` → `Create new file` → supply `path/to/file.md` → commit
* Edit file in UI: open file → click ✏️ → make changes → commit (optionally create new branch + PR)

---

## 20. Recommended Repo Hygiene & Best Practices

* **README** + **CONTRIBUTING.md** + **CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT.md** + **LICENSE**.
* Use **branch naming conventions**: `feature/`, `fix/`, `hotfix/`, `release/`.
* Protect `main` with branch rules and require CI checks.
* Keep secrets out of code—use Actions secrets and environment variables.
* Add `CODEOWNERS` to automate reviewer assignment for sensitive areas.
* Write clear commit messages and prefer small, modular PRs.
