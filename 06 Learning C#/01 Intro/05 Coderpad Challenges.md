   * May include **examples** and sometimes **hints**.

2. **Top Right – Code Editor (Your Answer)**

   * This is where you write your **solution**.
   * Starting code includes comments like `// Your code goes here`.

3. **Bottom Right – Code Usage Editor**

   * Shows how your solution is being called.
   * You can modify this to test with different inputs.

4. **Bottom Left – Console Output**

   * Displays program results.
   * Includes success/failure messages.
   * You can **scroll sideways** if the output text is too long.

> 💡 You can adjust the layout by dragging handles. For extra space, collapse the table of contents on the left.

## 🚀 Running and Testing Your Code

1. Write your solution in the **top right editor**.
2. Click **“Test my code”**.
3. Console shows results:

   * ✅ Correct → Your solution worked.
   * ❌ Incorrect → You’ll see expected output and possibly a hint.

### Example

* Challenge: Find the largest number in an array.
* Correct solution:

  ```csharp
  var result = numbers.Max();
  ```
