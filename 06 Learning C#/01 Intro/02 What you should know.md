# 📝 What You Should Know Before Starting C\#

Before diving into this course, there are some important concepts and skills you should already be familiar with. Let’s review them:

---

## 📌 Programming Background

* This course **is not meant for complete beginners** with zero programming experience.
* You should already have **basic foundational knowledge of programming**.
* You don’t need to be an expert, but you should understand **core programming concepts**, such as:

  * ✅ **Functions** → reusable blocks of code that perform tasks.
  * ✅ **Variables** → storing and manipulating data.
  * ✅ **Basic program structure** → how programs are built and executed.

## 🧱 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Since **C# is a fully object-oriented language**, you should be comfortable with:

* **Classes** → blueprints for creating objects.
* **Objects** → instances of classes.
* **Inheritance** → sharing and extending functionality between classes.

> 💡 *If these concepts are new to you, it’s better to take a step back and learn them first.*
