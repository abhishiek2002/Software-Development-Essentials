# 🌐 How the Internet Was Born

## 🧬 The Origins: A Government Project

The internet's roots go back to the **1960s**, a time when **digital communication** was just starting to develop.

It all began with a project from the **United States government**. In **1969**, a network called **ARPANET** (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was created by the **Department of Defense**.

ARPANET was built to transmit digital data **reliably** between distant locations. But to do that, it needed a way to break information into manageable chunks called **packets** that could be transmitted **simultaneously** across the network.

To accomplish this, a new set of rules was needed.

## 📜 The Birth of TCP/IP

In the **1970s**, computer scientists **Vint Cerf** and **Robert Kahn** developed:

* **TCP**: Transmission Control Protocol
* **IP**: Internet Protocol

Together, **TCP/IP** defined how data packets should be addressed, transmitted, routed, and received.

By **1982**, TCP/IP became the **official networking standard** for ARPANET, which stayed under government control through most of the **1980s**.

## 🌐 The Rise of the World Wide Web

In **1990**, at **CERN** (European Organization for Nuclear Research), **Tim Berners-Lee** revolutionized the Internet.

He created:

* An application called the **World Wide Web** (later renamed *Nexus*)
* The **first web browser**, on a **NeXT** computer
* The **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**
* The **Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)**
* The very first **web server**, called **httpd**

---

## 📈 The Commercial Web Begins

In **1991**, then-Senator **Al Gore** introduced the **High-Performance Computing Act**. This legislation led to funding for breakthrough technologies — including **Mosaic**, the first **commercially successful web browser**.

* **Mosaic** was created by **Marc Andreessen** and **Eric Bina** at the **National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)**.

---

## 📚 The Push for Web Standards

To promote an open, standardized web, Berners-Lee created:

> **W3C** – World Wide Web Consortium

This organization develops and maintains official **web standards** like:

* HTML
* CSS
* SVG

⚠️ But W3C is **slow**. It can take **years** for standards to go through review, recommendation, and approval.

Frustrated with the pace, new groups branched off — most notably:

> **WHATWG** – Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group

WHATWG maintains **HTML as a living standard** — continuously evolving and never truly "finished."

Meanwhile, W3C continues to adopt parts of WHATWG's work, such as with **HTML 5.1**.

## 🌍 Coordinating a Global Network

As the Internet grew, it needed a central coordinator. In **1998**, the following was formed:

> **ICANN** – Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers

ICANN is a **non-profit** that manages the "names" of the internet — like domain suffixes:

* **.com**
* **.net**
* **.gov**
* **.ca**, **.uk**, and more

It ensures each name maps to the correct numeric protocol.

---

## 🧭 The Browser Wars and Legacy

Andreessen later founded **Netscape Communications**, which played a huge role in making web browsers mainstream.

Over the last 20+ years, **Netscape technology** evolved into today’s popular browsers:

* **Google Chrome**
* **Microsoft Edge**
* **Apple Safari**
* **Mozilla Firefox**
* **Opera**

These companies continue to **expand**, **redefine**, and **shape** how we use the Internet.

But remember: at its core, the Internet is still built on the **same fundamental architecture** that began **50 years ago**.

It’s evolving — but its DNA remains.

# 🌍 Who Manages the Internet?

## ❓ Is There an Internet CEO?

Simple answer: **No.**

There is **no CEO, president, or ruler** of the Internet. No single government, organization, or individual has control over it.

Instead, the Internet is maintained through a **collaborative effort** of:

* **Government agencies**
* **International organizations**
* **Private companies**

These groups work together to maintain the **technologies** and **rules** that keep the Internet functioning.

## 🌐 How the Internet Works Like an Airport

Think of the Internet like a collection of **airports** (networks):

* Each airport is run by a different organization
* Planes (packets) need to know where they’re going
* Airports need to coordinate arrivals and departures

In aviation, the **International Air Transport Association (IATA)** created a global system of **three-letter airport codes**.

Likewise, on the Internet, **ICANN** serves that role:

* Manages **Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)**
* Assigns domains like **google.com**, **amazon.co.uk**, etc.

---

## 🌐 Internet Domains Explained

Examples:

* U.S. Government: **.gov**
* U.S. Commercial: **.com**
* Canada: **.ca** → `google.ca`
* UK: **.co.uk** → `amazon.co.uk`

These domains **help differentiate** websites by country and purpose.

## 🌐 Standards Bodies and Web Evolution

### Who defines web technologies?

Two major groups:

* **W3C** – World Wide Web Consortium
* **WHATWG** – Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group

These organizations write the **rules (standards/specs)** that browsers and developers follow.

They are made up of people from:

* **Private companies** (e.g., browser makers)
* **Open communities**

If one browser company wants to add a new feature that isn’t part of the spec, they can still do it — and their users might **demand** other browsers support it too.

Eventually, it might get added to the official spec.

---

## 💼 Power and Politics

While the Internet has no leader, **standards bodies and browser companies** have significant influence.

Sometimes, companies push **competing features**. This creates a bit of **politics**, but through collaboration and global consensus, these standards usually get resolved.

---

## 🌐 The Big Picture

> 🌍 The Internet runs through **global cooperation**.
>
> 📡 It’s powered by **protocols**, **agencies**, **companies**, and **users**.
>
> 🔧 It evolves as technology and ideas evolve — but always in service of one mission: **connecting the world**.
