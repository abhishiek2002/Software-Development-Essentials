# 🧭 Next Steps

As you've learned, computers and hardware have one giant limitation: **they can't do anything until you, the programmer, tell them exactly what to do**.

Your role is to act as a **translator of intent**—taking your ideas and translating them into a programming language that speaks directly to the machine.
