# 🐞 Debug Problems

Programming isn't a perfect process—and neither are programmers.

Bugs and errors are inevitable. But learning **how to debug** is what separates frustrated coders from productive developers.

---

## 🔍 Identify Mysterious Issues

Imagine you're calculating a shopping cart total, and the result is *wildly* off—like, "buy one get 10,000 free" levels of wrong.

You know something's broken, but where?

### 🧭 Tip: Trace Your Variables

You can track the state of variables during your program’s execution by:

* **Displaying text in your UI**
* **Logging messages to the console**
* **Sending alerts or notifications**

These breadcrumbs help you **pinpoint** where things go off the rails.

## 🛠️ Step Through Code With Debugging Tools

Many **IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)** and **web browsers** come with built-in debugging tools.

### 🐾 Set a Breakpoint

* Pick a line of code where you want your app to pause.
* When your program hits that line, execution stops.
* You enter **debug mode**, where you can:

  * Inspect variables
  * Run the program **line by line**
  * Step **into** functions and methods

This allows you to:

* Verify if your logic is executing as expected
* Catch accidental infinite loops
* Fix code running in the wrong order

## ⚠️ Throw and Catch Errors

Say you’re building a movie review class:

```js
class MovieReview {
  setRating(rating) {
    if (rating < 0 || rating > 5) {
      throw new Error("Rating must be between 0 and 5");
    }
    this.rating = rating;
  }
}
```

When an invalid rating is entered, your program **throws an exception**.

You can then **catch** it and respond helpfully:

```js
try {
  review.setRating(6);
} catch (error) {
  alert("Please choose a rating between 0 and 5.");
}
```

> ✨ Good code doesn't just avoid bugs—it handles them gracefully.

# 🛠️ Refactor Code to Make Improvements

Code is not set in stone. It evolves—just like your understanding of it.

> 🔁 Refactoring is the process of improving code **without changing what it does**.

---

## 🤔 Why Refactor?

### 1. 💨 Improve Performance

* Reduce memory or CPU use
* Eliminate unnecessary steps

### 2. ✨ Add New Features

* Sometimes old code needs tweaks to support new functionality

### 3. 📖 Improve Readability

* Rename variables and functions
* Add comments
* Make your code easier for *humans* to understand

---

## 🧠 Real-World Example

Suppose your old code had:

```js
let a = 10;
let b = 20;
let c = 30;
```

You later realize an array would be better:

```js
let values = [10, 20, 30];
```

You’re only halfway done. Now you must update **every other place** in your program that used `a`, `b`, or `c`.

> ✅ Refactoring is only complete when **all references** are updated and your code still works.

---

# 💾 Save Progress and Work with Others

Programming is iterative—you **build**, **refactor**, and sometimes… **backtrack**.

> To manage this, developers use **code repositories**.

---

## 🧳 Version Control with Git & GitHub

### 📸 1. Commits = Snapshots in Time

* A **commit** captures the exact state of your code
* Add a description to document what changed
* You can restore to this version later if needed

### 🌿 2. Branches = Parallel Universes

* A **branch** lets you build new features separately
* Keep your main code stable while experimenting
* Merge branches together when ready

### 🤝 3. Collaboration Made Easy

* Team members can work on different files
* Repositories notify you of changes
* Use a **diff** to compare and merge code

> Even if you're a solo developer, Git is your best friend. And with tools like GitHub, it scales to global teams.

# 🚀 Build Iteratively Using Agile Development

There are many ways to build software. One of the most popular is **Agile**.

> Agile = Build your product in phases, test it, and keep improving.

---

## 🎮 Let’s Say You’re Building a Tic-Tac-Toe App

You might not know upfront:

* Should users tap or swipe?
* Should it be 3x3 or 5x5?

That’s okay!

You start with a list of essential features, build them **one at a time**, release a working version, then iterate based on user feedback.

### 🏁 Sprints

* Short bursts of development
* Each sprint adds new functionality

### 🗺️ Roadmap

* A high-level plan for all the sprints
* Tracks what’s already built and what’s coming

> Agile is about flexibility. Instead of building for months before testing, you build fast, learn, and improve.

# 🌍 Create for Multiple Platforms

Your users are everywhere: different phones, browsers, devices.

> So your code should be too.

---

## 🧠 Key Reality

Developing for multiple platforms can seem overwhelming, but you have **options**:

### 🕸️ Web Development

* Different browsers? No problem.
* Modern frameworks handle most compatibility issues.

### 📱 Mobile/Desktop Apps

You’ve got **two main approaches**:

#### 🏢 1. First-Party Tools

* **Microsoft → Windows → C#**
* **Google → Android → Java**
* **Apple → iOS/macOS → Swift**

Though the tools differ, the **principles** are the same.

#### 🧰 2. Third-Party Tools

* **Cordova** (web-based)
* **Xamarin** (C#)
* **Unity** (game dev with C#/.NET)

These tools let you write once and deploy everywhere—though you might lose some fine-tuned capabilities.

> 📣 As a developer, your mission is to **reach as many people as possible**, across all platforms.
