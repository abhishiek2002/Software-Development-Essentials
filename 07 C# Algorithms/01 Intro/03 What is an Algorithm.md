# 🤔 What is an Algorithm?

## 📘 Definition

An **algorithm** is a **series of defined instructions** that perform a specific task. It’s essentially a **step-by-step process** to achieve a desired result.

## 🥪 Everyday Example: Making a Sandwich

Think of making a sandwich as an algorithm:

1. **Retrieve ingredients and tools** → Bread, knife, mustard/mayo, ham, cheese.
2. **Slice the bread**.
3. **Spread mustard or mayo** on the bread.
4. **Place ham and cheese** on the bread.
5. **Combine the bread slices** to complete the sandwich.

👉 While humans often perform such tasks automatically without thinking, a **computer cannot**. It requires **every single step** to be clearly defined.

## 💻 Algorithms in C\#

In programming (and especially in C#):

* **Every line of code** you write is part of an algorithm.
* Each instruction contributes to solving a task.

### Examples:

* **Finding even numbers** in an array.
* **Validating a string** to check if it has certain properties.

## 🔄 Multiple Ways to Solve the Same Task

* There are **different sets of instructions** (different algorithms) that can achieve the same result.
* Some are **more efficient** in terms of speed (time complexity) and memory usage (space complexity).
* Regardless of efficiency, what makes them **algorithms** is that they:

  1. Have **well-defined steps**.
  2. Aim to **complete a specific task**.

---

## ✅ Summary

* An algorithm is a **step-by-step procedure** for solving a problem.
* Computers need **explicitly defined steps**, unlike humans who can “fill in the blanks.”
* In C#, every instruction you write contributes to an algorithm.
* There may be multiple algorithms for the same task, with some being more efficient than others.

> 🔑 **Key Idea:** An algorithm = *A precise recipe for solving a problem*.
