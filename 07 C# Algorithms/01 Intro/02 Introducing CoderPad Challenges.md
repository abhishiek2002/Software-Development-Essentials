# 💻 Introducing CoderPad Challenges

## 🎯 Overview

This course includes **interactive coding challenges** powered by **CoderPad**. These challenges give you hands-on practice by allowing you to write, test, and run your own solutions directly inside the course environment.

They appear when you click on the **challenge links** in the course's Table of Contents. The challenges open in the same section of the course page where you normally watch videos.

## 🔑 CoderPad Challenge Layout

Each coding challenge has **four main areas**:

1. **Instructions Panel** 📝 → Displays the problem statement and requirements.
2. **Console Output** 🖨️ → Shows the results of your code when executed.
3. **Code Editor (Solution Area)** 💡 → Where you write your solution.
4. **Code Editor (Usage/Test Area)** 🧪 → Shows how your solution will be used and tested.

👉 You can **drag handles** to resize these areas and allocate space as per your preference.

## 🚀 Working Through a Challenge

1. **Read the instructions** carefully.
2. Write your solution in the **main code editor**.

   * The starter code includes **comments** to guide you on where to add your implementation.
3. Click **"Test My Code"** to check your solution.

   * If correct ✅ → You’ll see a success message.
   * If incorrect ❌ → A failure message will be displayed.

---

## 🆘 Getting Help When Stuck

If your code isn’t working:

* Use the **`ShowExpectedResult`** variable → Set it to `true` to see the correct output.
* Use the **`ShowHints`** variable → Set it to `true` to receive implementation hints.

📌 These options help guide you toward the correct approach without directly giving away the full solution.

---

## 🧪 Experimenting with Test Cases

* The **usage code editor** (lower-right corner) lets you modify test inputs.
* Example: Change the largest number in a test from **20 → 30**.

  * Console output will update with the new expected result (**30**).

This helps you understand how your solution behaves under different conditions.

## ✅ Completion

* After finishing a challenge, return to the course.
* Click **Next Video** ▶️ to watch the instructor’s solution and explanation.
