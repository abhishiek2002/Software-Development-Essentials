# üöÄ What is Git?

Git is a **version control** (or **source control**) system that allows you to manage changes to files over time. Think of it as being both a **historian** and a **time traveler** for your projects ‚Äî you can document, revisit, and even rewrite history.

## üï∞ Git as Your Time Machine

* **Commits**: These are checkpoints in your project‚Äôs history. Each commit can have a message describing what happened at that point.
* **Branching**: Create alternate versions of your code (like parallel universes).
* **Merging**: Combine changes from one branch into another.
* You can switch between branches or commits to explore or restore previous states.

**Analogy:** Imagine writing a book where each draft is saved, and you can branch off to try an alternate ending without losing the original.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started with Git

Before you can use Git (or GitHub), you need a few tools:

1. **Install Git**

   * Visit [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) (SCM = Source Control Management).
   * Download the installer for your OS and follow the default installation options.
   * On Windows, you can optionally install **Git Bash**, which lets you use Linux-style commands.

2. **Terminal Access**

   * **Mac**: Use the built-in Terminal or an alternative like **Hyper**.
   * **Windows**: Use Git Bash, PowerShell, or Hyper.
   * **Command Tip**: On Linux/macOS, use `ls` to list files; on Windows Command Prompt, use `dir`.

3. **Code Editor**

   * Recommended: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

4. **Node.js** (for most web projects)

   * Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

## üóÇ Basic Git Workflow Recap

1. **Initialize** or **clone** a repository.
2. Make edits in your **working directory**.
3. **Commit** changes with meaningful messages.
4. Use **branches** to experiment without breaking the main code.
5. **Merge** or discard experimental branches as needed.

üí° **Pro Tip:** Treat commit messages as if your future self (or another developer) will rely on them to understand *why* you made those changes ‚Äî because they will.
