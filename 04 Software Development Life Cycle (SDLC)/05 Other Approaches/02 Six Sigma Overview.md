# 📈 Six Sigma Overview

## 🔹 What is Six Sigma?

Six Sigma is a **quality improvement methodology** that originated in manufacturing but is now used across industries including software.

> 📌 Developed at **Motorola** in the 1980s and later popularized by **Jack Welch at General Electric** in the 1990s.

### 🎯 Objective:

To **reduce defects** and ensure outputs stay within **defined quality limits**.

### 📊 Key Concepts:

* Uses **scientific and statistical approaches** to improve process quality
* Tracks **defects per million opportunities (DPMO)**
* Aims for **higher sigma levels**, which means **fewer defects**

| Sigma Level | Approximate DPMO | Quality Level |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| 3σ          | 66,807           | 93.3%         |
| 4σ          | 6,210            | 99.38%        |
| 5σ          | 233              | 99.97%        |
| 6σ          | 3.4              | 99.99966%     |

🔺 **Higher sigma = better quality**

## 🔹 Six Sigma in Software Development

Software development differs from manufacturing:

* It is part **science**, part **art**
* Products are **not identical** every time
* Influenced by **team skills, culture, politics, technology**, etc.

Despite challenges, Six Sigma can still bring value at a **macro-level** using high-level process improvements.

## 🔹 The DMAIC Cycle – Six Sigma’s Core

Six Sigma includes a powerful process improvement model: **DMAIC**

### 🌀 DMAIC Phases:

| Phase   | Description                                                                            |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Define  | Identify the **problem or opportunity**<br>🛠️ Use tools like **Value Stream Mapping** |
| Measure | Decide **what to measure** and **how**<br>📊 Use tools like **Pareto charts**          |
| Analyze | Investigate **root causes of variation**<br>🔍 Use tools like **Fishbone Diagram**     |
| Improve | Apply solutions to **reduce or eliminate defects**<br>🧠 Use **Affinity Diagrams**     |
| Control | Monitor and **sustain** improvements<br>📈 Use **Control Charts**                      |

📌 The DMAIC cycle is **data-driven** and applies to **both software and non-software** initiatives.

## 🧩 Practical Software Example

> 📌 A team applied DMAIC to **compare two software products**.
>
> * One had **50% more defects** due to being **over-engineered**
> * Result: Identified and improved the delivery process for one product

💡 Even **partial use** of DMAIC can result in **tangible improvements**.

## 🔗 Lean + Six Sigma = Powerful Combo

* **Lean** focuses on **minimizing waste**
* **Six Sigma** focuses on **reducing variation**
* Together, they help build **highly optimized delivery processes**

> 📌 Even if you don't measure sigma exactly, understanding **DMAIC** empowers you to improve any process.

## 🧠 Final Thought

> “Six Sigma may not be perfect for all software projects, but DMAIC is a tool every process improvement effort can benefit from.”
