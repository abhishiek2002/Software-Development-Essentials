# 🔢 Abstraction of Numbers & Binary — Full Conceptual Breakdown

> *A deeply structured, creative Markdown version of the full transcript. Ideal for total recall and intuitive understanding.*

---

## 📊 What Are Numbers, Really?

We often think of numbers as just digits (0–9), e.g., `723`. That number could mean:

* \$723
* 723 yards of yarn
* 723 gallons of milk

The **number** itself is an **abstraction**—a symbolic way to represent *how much* of something exists.

## 🔣 Number Systems — More Than One Way

### 🏛 Roman Numerals

* Symbols: I, V, X, L, C, M
* Represent numbers via **combinations and positions**
* Limited to 3 consecutive symbols (e.g., III = 3, but never IIII)

### 🔟 Decimal System (Base-10)

* Digits: 0 to 9
* Columns represent exponential powers of 10:

  * Ones → \$10^0\$
  * Tens → \$10^1\$
  * Hundreds → \$10^2\$

### 🧮 Example: 723

| Digit | Power    | Value     |
| ----- | -------- | --------- |
| 7     | \$10^2\$ | 700       |
| 2     | \$10^1\$ | 20        |
| 3     | \$10^0\$ | 3         |
|       |          | **= 723** |

## 🧑‍🔬 Changing the Base — Octal & Hex

### 🟠 Octal (Base-8)

* Digits: 0–7
* 723 in octal = 467 in decimal
* Formula changes: powers of **8** instead of 10

### 🟣 Hexadecimal (Base-16)

* Digits: 0–9 and A–F (A = 10, B = 11, ..., F = 15)
* 723 in hex = 1827 in decimal
* Used in **web design colors**, memory addresses, etc.

> RGB color codes in CSS are hex values: `#FF0000` (Red), `#00FF00` (Green), `#0000FF` (Blue)

## 🧠 Rules of Number Systems

Every positional number system follows:

1. **Base number** → max digits available
2. **Multiple columns** → increase exponentially from right to left
3. **Formula** → Digit × Base^Column\_Index

This logic applies to decimal, octal, hex, and... yes...

## 💻 Binary — Foundation of Computing

### ⚙️ Binary Basics

* Base-2 → only **0** and **1**
* Columns increase in powers of **2**

#### 🧾 Example: 10011 (binary)

| Column (Power) | Binary Digit | Calculation |
| -------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| \$2^4\$ (16)   | 1            | 16          |
| \$2^3\$ (8)    | 0            | 0           |
| \$2^2\$ (4)    | 0            | 0           |
| \$2^1\$ (2)    | 1            | 2           |
| \$2^0\$ (1)    | 1            | 1           |
|                |              | **= 19**    |

### 🔁 Convert Decimal to Binary (e.g., 23):

1. Largest \$2^x\$ < 23 = \$2^4\$ = 16 → mark `1`
2. 23 − 16 = 7 → largest \$2^x\$ < 7 = \$2^2\$ = 4 → mark `1`
3. 7 − 4 = 3 → \$2^1\$ = 2 → mark `1`
4. 3 − 2 = 1 → \$2^0\$ = 1 → mark `1`

**Result:** 10111

## 🧮 Bit Size and Value Capacity

| Bit Size | Max Value (unsigned) |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| 2-bit    | 3 (values 0–3)       |
| 8-bit    | 255 (0–255)          |
| 16-bit   | 65,535               |
| 32-bit   | \~4.29 billion       |
| 64-bit   | \~18 quintillion     |

* **Signed numbers** → one bit reserved for sign (positive or negative)

  * 32-bit signed max = \~2.14 billion

---

## 🧰 Variables & Storage in Programming

* Variables = **containers** for data
* Example:

  * 8-bit variable = 1 byte = can store up to 255
  * 32-bit = 4 bytes = can store over 4 billion

### 💡 Decimal Numbers?

* Basic integer variables can’t store decimals
* Use special **floating-point** types (like `float`, `double`)

### 🧾 Spreadsheet Example

* Excel has \~1M rows × 16K columns = \~17 billion cells
* Each cell = 8 bytes (64 bits)
* **Total storage**: \~128 GB

> 📉 Even small data types can grow huge fast. Efficient memory usage is critical.

---

## ⚠️ Overflow — When Bits Aren’t Enough

### 🚨 What is Overflow?

* Happens when a value **exceeds reserved bit space**

#### 🧮 Example (8-bit):

* Max = 255
* 255 + 1 = **0** (wraps around)

### 🧮 Glitch Example:

* 186 + 92 = 278 → But in 8-bit: Result = **22**

### 🐞 Y2K Bug

* Years like 1985 stored as `85`
* Year 2000 = `00` = **interpreted as 1900**
* Fixed by switching to 4-digit year storage

---

## 🗓 Date Representation in Binary

### 📆 Epoch Time (Unix Time)

* Stores number of seconds **since Jan 1, 1970 at 00:00 UTC**
* Stored in **signed 32-bit** format

### 🚨 Year 2038 Problem

* 32-bit signed time maxes out on **Jan 19, 2038 at 3:14:07 UTC**
* Wraps around → becomes **Dec 13, 1901 at 20:45:52 UTC**
* Rooted in the **sign bit flipping**

---

## ⚠️ Overflow in Signed Numbers

### 🧮 Example:

* 23,390 + 30,000 = **-20,622**
* Due to bit overflow & sign bit wrapping
