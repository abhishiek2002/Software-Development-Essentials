## What is Computer Science?

Computer science is much more than just coding and programming. It is the study of how hardware and software work together to create the tools and technologies that shape our world.  
Computers handle information in many forms—text, numbers, images, sounds, and logic. To do this, they must convert what we see, hear, and understand into a digital format that machines can process. This process is called **abstraction**: simplifying complex real-world data into a form that computers can use.

At the heart of this digital representation is **binary**—a system of ones and zeroes, or yes and no. Binary is the foundation of all computer operations. It enables computers to represent:

- Numerical values
- Characters and text
- Images and video
- Logic and instructions

As technology evolves, binary continues to be the basis for new innovations, including virtual and augmented reality. Understanding binary and digital representation is essential for anyone who wants to harness the power of computers, whether for programming, data analysis, or creative applications.

## Course Overview

This course is designed for anyone curious about how computers, hardware, and software work.  
**No prior programming experience is required.** You don’t need any special devices or computers to participate.

The curriculum is based on the College Board Computer Science Principles Advanced Placement (AP) framework. It is suitable for:

- High school students
- Adults interested in learning about computers
- Those preparing for computer science programs or careers
- Anyone wanting a foundation for programming and coding

Educators will find that this course covers four of the seven "Big Ideas" from the AP curriculum:

1. **Creativity:** How computers enable creative solutions and new ways of thinking.
2. **Abstraction:** How complex information is simplified for computers.
3. **Data and Information:** How computers store, process, and analyze data.
4. **Global Impact:** How computing affects society and the world.

This course is part of a series that will eventually cover all areas of the AP curriculum and extend into practical applications of these concepts.
