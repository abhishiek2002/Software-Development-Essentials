# Summary

```
- The basis for everything we do with computers is taking what we work with in the physical world, like images, text, numbers, symbols, and more, and abstract it into a format that computers can process, store, and transmit. Using binary bits, states of on or off, information can be encoded and decoded using standardized protocols. This allows information to be saved and retrieved or sent and received. But there are some limitations like working within bit sizes, preventing overflows, and conforming to encoding protocols like ASCII or Unicode. But with binary, it is possible to take anything we can represent in the real world and abstract it into a native format for computers. Understanding how this process works is key to understanding how information is transmitted over the internet, how to program and build applications that use computer resources, such as memory, storage and equipment, and save and work with data to perform calculations and analysis. Yes or no, on or off, one or zero. It really all comes down to that and you can build anything on top of that using computer science.

# 🧾 Summary Notes: Binary Data Representation

## 💡 Core Idea

* Computers process, store, and transmit **real-world information** (images, text, numbers, symbols, etc.) by **abstracting** it into binary format.
* Binary = **1s and 0s** (on/off states).

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 🎯 Binary Encoding:

* All data is represented in **binary (bits)**.
* Bit = basic unit (1 or 0, on or off).
* Allows data to be:

  * **Encoded/Decoded**
  * **Stored/Retrieved**
  * **Transmitted/Received**

### 🧰 Standardized Protocols:

* Encoding standards make binary data understandable:

  * **ASCII** (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
  * **Unicode** (for broader language support)

### ⚠️ Limitations:

* Must work within:

  * **Bit sizes** (e.g., 8-bit, 16-bit, etc.)
  * **Memory/storage constraints**
  * **Encoding protocols** (to prevent errors like overflow)

### 🔄 Abstraction in Action:

* Anything representable in the real world can be translated into a **binary-native format**.
* This enables:

  * Communication over the **internet**
  * Running software applications
  * Efficient **use of memory/storage**
  * Performing **calculations and analysis**

### ✅ Ultimate Principle:

> **Yes or no. On or off. One or zero.** Everything in computing boils down to this.

You can build **anything** with this foundation — that’s the power of **computer science**.
