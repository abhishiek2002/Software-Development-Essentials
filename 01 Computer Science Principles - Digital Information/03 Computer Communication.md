# 🧠 Binary and Digital Communication — Complete Recap

> *A creative & structured Markdown digest of the full video transcript to help you deeply recall every concept with clarity.*

---

## ✅ YES or NO — The Foundation of Computing

* **Are the lights on?** That question has just **two** answers: `Yes` or `No`.
* This simple binary decision — yes/no, on/off — is the **core principle** of all computers.

### 🔢 Binary System

* A **binary system** has only two states: `1` and `0`.
* `1` = ON
* `0` = OFF
* Computers use **trillions** of these binary switches.

### 🧮 Boolean Values

* Boolean = `True` or `False`
* Example: “Do I have more than 3 pencils?” → Answer: `True` or `False`

### 📊 Binary as Numbers

* Binary digits can be grouped to make **numbers**, which computers interpret in various ways.

---

## 🧱 Bits & Bytes — Digital Building Blocks

### 🔹 What’s a Bit?

* A **bit** is a single binary digit — `1` or `0`.
* It’s the **smallest** unit of storage in computing.

### 🔸 What’s a Byte?

* A **byte** = 8 bits
* Common data size units:

  * **1 KB** = 1,024 bytes
  * **1 MB** = 1,024 KB
  * **1 GB** = 1,024 MB
  * **1 TB** = 1,024 GB

> 🧠 A terabyte contains **\~9 trillion bits**. That’s 9 trillion on/off states!

## 🔁 Encoding & Decoding — Turning Info into Bits

### 🔄 Encoding

* Translating human-readable data (text, image, video) → Binary
* Example: `"Hello"` → `01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111`

### 🔁 Decoding

* Reversing binary back → Human-recognizable data
* All data transmission (texts, docs, songs, videos) use this process.

### 🔐 Protocol

* A **protocol** defines:

  * How bits are encoded & sent
  * How messages are structured
  * How they’re interpreted correctly on the other end

---

## 💬 Communicating with Bits

### 🧠 Simple Message Example

**Question:** “Am I happy?”

* Answer as bit: `1` for Yes, `0` for No
* But for it to work, both sender & receiver must know the **context** of that bit.

### 📦 Sending Multiple Bits

**Questions:**

1. Am I hungry?
2. Am I thirsty?
3. Am I bored?
4. Am I tired?

* Send answers as 4 bits (e.g., `1 0 1 1`)
* **Bit Size** = 4 (so the receiver knows how many bits to expect)

### ⏱ Bitrate

* **Bitrate** = Number of bits sent per second
* Example:

  * 1 bps = 1 bit/second
  * 2 bps = 2 bits/second
* Both sender and receiver **must agree** on the bitrate

### 🔁 Two-Way Communication

* Sender sends a 4-bit message → Receiver decodes
* Receiver replies with same structure

### 🚦 End of Message Bit

Add a 5th bit: **“Am I finished?”**

* 0 → No, continue sending
* 1 → Yes, ready for response

> 🔁 This structure enables continuous, two-way, bit-based communication.

## 🌍 Digital Communication — Three Main Transmission Methods

### 📡 1. Radio (Wi-Fi)

* Wi-Fi = **Radio waves** encode binary
* Signal is encoded using **variations in wave**
* Limitations:

  * Works well short-distance
  * Weakens with distance
  * Radio noise/interference
  * Needs unique channels to avoid overlap

### 🔌 2. Electrical (Ethernet)

* **Electric pulses** in cables = binary 1s and 0s
* Used in Ethernet, LANs, office networks
* More reliable than radio over short to medium distances
* Limitation: Slower and less reliable across long distances

### 🔦 3. Optical (Fiber Optic)

* Uses **pulses of light** through glass or plastic cables
* Speed: \~200,000 km/sec
* Extremely fast and reliable
* Used for long-distance (undersea cables, continental links)
* Limitation: High **cost**

> ✨ Radio → Personal devices
> ⚡ Electrical → Homes & offices
> 💡 Optical → Global backbones

## 🕳 Encoding with Light

* Light on = `1`
* Light off = `0`

> What if you want to send 3 zeroes in a row?

* You need to agree on **bitrate**!
* 1 bit per second → 3 seconds of no light = `000`

---

## 🚀 Bandwidth vs Bitrate vs Latency

### 📶 Bandwidth

* Max bits that can be sent per second (capacity)
* Example:

  * USB 3.0 = **5 Gbps** (Gigabits/second)
  * Wi-Fi 802.11b = **11 Mbps**
  * Wi-Fi 802.11ac = **1300 Mbps**

> Note: Gbps ≠ GBps → 1 Byte = 8 Bits

### ⏱ Latency

* Time delay for a message to travel
* Measured in **milliseconds (ms)**
* Affects **two-way** communication responsiveness

---

## 🔁 Compatibility & Standards

* Wi-Fi uses versions like:

  * 802.11b
  * 802.11g
  * 802.11n
  * 802.11ac

* Devices need to **support the same standard** to talk to each other

* New routers support **multiple standards** → Backward compatibility

---

## 🪐 Space Communication

* We even communicate with **probes in space** using binary bits
* Light and radio are used
* **Longer distances = higher latency** (months or years)
* Example: Pluto probe → Earth takes a long time
